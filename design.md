# Character and game design for Strategic Fighting System

## Character

### Character attributes

The following are integer values that qualitatively describe semi-permanent aspects of a character. They can be improved over the course of gameplay through character level advancement and major storyline events. In all cases, a higher number means a greater possession of that attribute.

The scale of these values is not yet determined.

1. **Martial Prowess**: an overall assessment of the character's combat abilities. Can be called "Prowess" for short.
2. **Hardiness**: the character's ability to take physical damage without suffering long-term consequences. Higher levels mean that it takes more "stopping power" to cause the character physical harm.
3. **Injury**. long-term or permanent incapacitation suffered by the character from battle or through story effects. The level of Injury determines how many Fight Points a character can use in each round.
   1. *Uninjured*. 100% of a character's Martial Prowess can be allocated as Fight Points each round.
   2. *Bruised*. 90% of a character's Martial Prowess can be allocated as Fight Points each round. It takes a few hours to a few days for a Bruised to recover up to Uninjured.
   3. *Wounded*. 50% Martial Prowess. Recovery takes several weeks to get back up to Bruised.
   4. *Crippled*. 25% Martial Prowess. Recovery takes several months to get back up to Wounded.

## Combat Mechanics

Combat occurs in discrete *rounds*. Each round consists of *phases*.

### Combat Round Phases

1. **Initialization phase**. Players are given a number of Fight Points to spend this round. The number of Fight Points for each character is equal to that character's Martial Prowess (taking Injury into account) minus Wear.  
2. **Presentation allocation phase**.
