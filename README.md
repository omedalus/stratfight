# Strategic Fighting
A combat system whose primary focus is strategy and cost/benefit analysis, not twitch reflexes.

## Raison d'etre
Fighting systems in roleplaying games tend to be very unsatisfying. In a game driven by plot and character, the fighting experience should be focused on the stakes of the fight, the implications of engaging in the fight, the different *ways* to engage in the fight, and other high-level decisions. The actual minutia of the fighting should be left to the *character*, not the *player*. The player should focus on the character development and story, and a combat system for a roleplaying game should emphasize the *drama* and *tension* of the combat rather than the mechanics therein.

### Real-time combat tests the motor skills of the *player*, not the *character*

The exact movements and maneuvers that the protagonist takes in the process of fighting require kinesthetic control and awareness that doesn't map well to the user interface of a screen and controller, and is too minute and mundane to be of concern to the story.


Specifically, they tend to have a very different flavor than the rest of the game.
