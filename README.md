# Strategic Fighting
A combat system whose primary focus is strategy and cost/benefit analysis, not twitch reflexes.

## Raison d'etre
Fighting systems in roleplaying games tend to be very unsatisfying. In a game driven by plot and character, the fighting experience should be focused on the stakes of the fight, the implications of engaging in the fight, the different *ways* to engage in the fight, and other high-level decisions. The actual minutia of the fighting should be left to the *character*, not the *player*. The player should focus on the character development and story, and a combat system for a roleplaying game should emphasize the *drama* and *tension* of the combat rather than the mechanics therein.

### Real-time combat systems test the motor skills of the *player*, not the *character*
The exact movements and maneuvers that the protagonist takes in the process of fighting require kinesthetic control and awareness that doesn't map well to the user interface of a screen and controller, and in any case is too minute and mundane to be of concern to the story. In games that otherwise focus on topics like dialog engagement and quest completion, the requirement of the player to learn how to execute combat maneuvers is a major break in immersion, introducing an arcade-like element that many players find unwelcome. It requires the player not merely to direct the character during combat, but to actually *participate* in that combat, which requires a very different skillset -- a skillset that's less cerebral and more reflex-driven.

Modern RPGs try to mitigate the difference in players' ability and willingness to execute combat primarily through a few approaches: 1. By offerring many different combat styles, such as melee/ranged/magic; 2. Offering earnable combat perks that change the game's combat UI; and 3. Permitting the player to adjust combat difficulty to compensate for their own relative lack of physical talent. Both of these mitigations are imperfect. 

The offering of many different combat styles does lend itself to a satisfying degree of character customization, but that customization is driven by the player's necessity rather than their roleplaying objectives (or the roleplaying objectives of the game's writers). For example, a player may wish to roleplay a big hulking tank but find themselves simply physically unable to operate the controller to deliver melee attacks appropriately. Such a player may choose to play the character as an archer instead, but that player would be making that choice not because their *character* can't fight melee, but because the *player* can't fight melee. This undermines a major point of roleplaying.

The earning of combat perks to change the game UI amounts to little more than making the player work to compensate for the combat system's inherent emphasis on the player's physical abilities in place of the character's. For example, many games permit the character to earn an upgrade that causes time to slow down while they're aiming a ranged weapon. In theory, this time slowdown represents an improvement in the character's aiming ability. In practice, however, all it is is the game compensating for the fact that *I as a player* need more time to aim, and the game is making *me the player* perform the task of aiming. This "aiming time dilation" has nothing to do with the ranged accuracy of the character; the same character controlled by a player with better hand-eye coordination could very well have a higher ranged hit percentage, even without the time dilation perk. My character doesn't need the time dilation perk; *I the player* need the time dilation perk. I shouldn't need to burn gaming hours to work to earn XP and level up and allocate proficiencies all for the task of making me the player physically able to make the character do things that the character can do anyway at the hands of another player with better arcade skills.

The ability to adjust combat difficulty often directly detracts from the gaming experience for the simple fact that only the most casual of gamers wants to win a game on Easy mode. A major fight in the game elicits drama and tension because it's difficult for the character, and victory is not guaranteed. Real-time combat systems make it difficult for the character by making the fight difficult *for the player* -- which, for all of the problems listed above, is still at least successful at preserving the tension of a major boss-fight. By making it easy for the player, real-time combat systems end up effectively making it easy *for the character*, thereby making the story feel cheap and hollow. 

Ultimately, when you win, you want it to be because you made good decisions, not because the game *let* you. And when you lose, you want it to be because you made difficult choices that had regrettable but in hindsight foreseeable consequences, not because you failed to mash the right sequence of buttons at the right time.

### Turn-based D&D-style combat systems are repetitive and micromanagerial
Turn-based combat eliminates the need for the player to learn any part of the motor skills of the character. For this reason, turn-based combat tends to be most favored in story-oriented media, such as tabletop Dungeons and Dragons or Japanese RPGs.

Unfortunately, it's precisely in such media that the tedium of turn-based combat becomes most apparent. An enormous fraction of game-hours spent in a JPRG is comprised of navigating the same menu, selecting the same attack option, and then watching the same unskippable animation. Some variety is occasionally introduced by having to fight enemies with specific immunities or vulnerabilities, or physically arranging the characters on the battlefield to make optimal use of an area-based effect, but such decision-making is still very small in scale.

The core issue is that it rarely matters *to the story* that some area-of-effect spell occurred at a specific time, or that a specific number of hitpoints of damage was done on a specific combat turn. These are *tactical* considerations. 

Now, tactical considerations in and of themselves aren't a bad thing. Both in literature/cinema and in the real world, tactical events *may* have emergent story-level significance. History has no shortage of examples of an otherwise weak underdog cleverly goading his significantly more powerful opponents into a trap, or a small army making use of terrain and weather to hold its own against a force many times its size, or the tide of an entire war turning because a battlefield commander was felled by one specific shot.

The problem is that these are extremely rare *exceptions* in the context of turn-based game combat. A D&D-style or JRPG-style combat system is one in which such story-defining tactical maneuvers *can* happen, but the rarity with which they *do* happen makes the system itself detract significantly from the tale being told. For games that are ostensibly dedicated to storytelling, it doesn't make sense for huge durations of time -- in some cases more than half the total hours of playtime -- to be spent in a number-crunching combat system in the often futile hope that *maybe* some battlefield detail *might* have some non-vanishing significance.
