# Character and game design for Strategic Fighting System

## Character

### Character attributes

The following are integer values that qualitatively describe semi-permanent aspects of a character. They can be improved over the course of gameplay through character level advancement and major storyline events. In all cases, a higher number means a greater possession of that attribute.

The scale of these values is not yet determined.

1. **Martial Prowess**: an overall assessment of the character's combat abilities. Can be called "Prowess" for short.
2. **Hardiness**: the character's ability to take physical damage without suffering long-term consequences. Higher levels mean that it takes more "stopping power" to cause the character physical harm. In game mechanics, this translates into being able to take more Damage without an increase in Injury.
3. **Injury**. long-term or permanent incapacitation suffered by the character from battle or through story effects. The level of Injury modulates Martial Prowess to determine how many Fight Points a character can use in each round.
   

## Combat Mechanics

Combat occurs in discrete *rounds*. Each round consists of *phases*.

### Combat Round Phases

1. **Initialization phase**. Players are given a number of Fight Points to spend this round. The number of Fight Points for each character is equal to that character's Martial Prowess (taking Injury into account) minus Wear.  
2. **Presentation allocation phase**.
